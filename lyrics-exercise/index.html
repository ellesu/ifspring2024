                <i>[Verse 1]</i><br>
                I've been cheated by you since I don't know when <br>
                So I made up my mind, it must come to an end <br>
                Look at me now, will I ever learn <br>
                I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control <br>
                There's a fire within my soul <br><br>

                <i>[Pre-chorus]</i><br>
                and I can hear a bell ring <br>
                (One more look) and I forget everything, whoa <br><br>

                <i>[Chorus]</i><br>
                Mamma mia, here I go again<br>
                My, my, how can I resist you?<br>
                Mamma mia, does it show again<br>
                My, my, just how much I've missed you?<br>
                Yes, I've been brokenhearted<br>
                Blue since the day we parted<br>
                Why, why did I ever let you go?<br>
                Mamma mia, now I really know<br>
                My, my, I could never let you go<br><br>

                <i>[Verse 2]</i><br>
                I've been angry and sad about things that you do<br>
                I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through<br>
                And when you go, when you slam the door<br>
                I think you know that you won't be away too long<br>
                You know that I'm not that strong<br><br>

                <i>[Pre-chorus]</i><br>
                and I can hear a bell ring<br>
                (One more look) and I forget everything, whoa<br><br>

                <i>[Chorus]</i><br>
                Mamma mia, here I go again<br>
                My, my, how can I resist you?<br>
                Mamma mia, does it show again<br>
                My, my, just how much I've missed you?<br>
                Yes, I've been brokenhearted<br>
                Blue since the day we parted<br>
                Why, why did I ever let you go?<br>
                Mamma mia, even if I say<br>
                Bye-bye, leave me now or never<br>
                Mamma mia, it's a game we play<br>
                Bye-bye doesn't mean forever<br>
                Mamma mia, here I go again<br>
                My, my, how can I resist you?<br>
                Mamma mia, does it show again<br>
                My, my, just how much I've missed you?<br>
                Yes, I've been brokenhearted<br>
                Blue since the day we parted<br>
                Why, why did I ever let you go?<br>
                Mamma mia, now I really know<br>
                My, my, I could never let you go<br>
