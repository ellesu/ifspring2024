            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <li><i>Background</i>
                <p>My name is Elle, and I am a junior CS & Econ major with minors in HCI and marketing</p></li>
            <li><i>Motivation</i>
                <p>Since most of my experiences and background has an emphasis on coding and scripting, I want to learn more about styling and front end.</p></li>
            <li><i>Past Experience</i>
                <p>I took 330S &#40;Rapid Prototyping & Web Development&#41; during the fall of 2022. I also created a Wordpress site with custom HTML/CSS for my friend's family business.</p>
            </li>
            <li><i>Hopes for 338I</i>
                <p>I hope to learn more about styling principles and how to execute them. I have limited experiences with animating elements in CSS and hope to explore that more.</p></li>
            <li><i>Differences between digital and traditional mediums</i>
                <p>I expect designing on the screen to have more restrictions than traditional mediums, since everything from the margins to the scroll behavior must be coded. In the past, the styling of my more complex pages have often been finnicky and hard to debug.</p></li>
            <li><i href="apple.com">Effective Design Example</i>
                <p>I have always admired the <a href="apple.com">Apple website</a> for its effective design. Whenever a new product is launched, the animations are always flawless and demonstrate the different functions and capabilities of their products.</p></li>
            <li><i href="https://www.nytimes.com/">Effective Communication Example</i>
                <p>I like how the <a href="nytimes.com">The New York Times</a> website conveys the same information hierarchy as its traditional counterpart, the newspaper. It has a simple yet elegant design that makes the website intuitive and easy to navigate.</p></li>
            <li><i>A website that works well</i>
                <p>The <a href="https://unseen.co/">Unseen Studio</a> website is very effective in both communication and design. Since it is a motion and sound studio, its website clearly conveys both those aspects via sound and movement on their landing and loading pages.</p></li>
